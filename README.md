# Recreational Sports App 

This is an android application for the [student life](https://recsports.osu.edu/) in [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu). 


# Description

Office of Student Life provides handful of events of recreational sports for students every day. However, events are only listed on the student life website. If students want to know what events are provided today or in the future dates, they have to go to the website and remember the date and time or log in to their accounts to add event. Our mobile app allows students to conveniently access the sports schedule through phones and add to their phone calendar and receive notification in less time.

The app will also provide feed from the rec sports twitter account for latest news and updates.
